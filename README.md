- No upfront cost, minimal charges beyond free limits.
- It ensures robust security.

- Automated bulk payouts for vendors
- Real-time payment status tracking & transaction reconciliation
- Support for multiple payment modes (IMPS/NEFT/RTGS/UPI)
- Pre-built templates for workflows and notifications
- Configurable to cater to diverse business processes

## üöÄ Why Use This Integration?

- <em>Save Time</em>: Eliminate manual bank transactions from netbanking portals
- <em>Reduce Errors</em>: Auto-sync payment data between ERPNext and Bank
