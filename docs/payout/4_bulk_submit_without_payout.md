# 📦 Bulk Submit for Marked Online Payment

## 🛠️ How Bulk Submission Works

1. **Bulk Submit Payment Entries**:  
   - When users bulk submit **Payment Entries** from the list view using the **Actions** menu (instead of **Pay and Submit**):  
     - For Payment Entries with **Make Online Payment** checked, this option will be **automatically unchecked**.  
     - The Payment Entries will be submitted **without initiating payouts**.  

2. **Make Payout After Submission**:  
   - After submission, users can still make payouts manually using the **Make Payout** button for each Payment Entry.

**Note**: The example above demonstrates the process for one Payment Entry, but the same applies to any number of entries.
