   - If unchecked, a confirmation dialog will appear for single Payment Entry cancellations if the payout or payout link is cancellable.  
   - See [Cancellation Workflow](https://github.com/resilient-tech/razorpayx-integration/blob/version-15/docs/payout/5_cancel_payout.md) for more details.  

2. **Pay on Auto Submit**
   - This feature is only available if the [Payments Processor](https://github.com/resilient-tech/payments-processor) app is installed.  
   - **Checked** ‚òëÔ∏è by default.  
   - If a `Payment Entry` is submitted via automation, the payout will be made if `Make Online Payment` is checked in the Payment Entry.  
   - If unchecked and the Payment Entry is submitted with the `initiated_by_payment_processor` flag, the payout will not be made, and `Make Online Payment` will be unchecked.
