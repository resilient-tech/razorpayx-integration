# üí≥ Make RazorpayX Payout with Payment Entry

## ‚úÖ Requirements

1. **RazorpayX Configuration**: At least one configuration must be available.
2. **Company Bank Account**: Must be set and associated with the RazorpayX Configuartion.
3. **Payment Type**: `Pay`
4. **Paid from Account Currency**: `INR`
5. **User Permissions**:
   - Role: `Online Payment Authorizer`.
   - Permission to submit `Payment Entry`.
6. **Make Online Payment**: Ensure this checkbox is checked.
   - If unchecked, you can still make a payout after submission if the integration setting is configured.

## üìå Notes

- Here **Payout and Payout Link** are considered one entity.
  - To pay via **Payout Link**, choose the transfer mode as `Link`.
  - Payouts created via **Payout Link** will be managed as payouts, not as payout links.
    - Example:
      - Only **Payout** statuses are maintained as `RazorpayX Payout Status`.
      - The status will show as `Not Initiated` or `Queued` until the payout is created.
      - Once the payout is initiated via the payout link, the status will update based on webhook events.
      - If the payout is canceled or fails, the payout link will also be canceled.

- The **Make Online Payment** checkbox appears after saving the Payment Entry (PE) for the first time if the integration is found.

- If RazorpayX is configured after creating the PE, reselect the **Company Bank Account** and save the PE to set integartion.

- If an **Amended Payment Entry** has its original PE marked for `Make Online Payment`, the amended PE will not create a payout.
  - Payment details cannot be changed in such cases.

- If a **Payout** or **Payout Link** is canceled/failed and the webhook event is captured, the Payment Entry will also be canceled.

- If a **Payout** is reversed, only the status will be updated, and the PE will not be canceled.

- **Payment Authentication Method**: OTP App (See `System Settings` Login tab)
